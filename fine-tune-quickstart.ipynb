The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

Ordered Fried Pickles ($4) and Pork Buns ($6) for appetizers, the Graze Burger ($19!!) and the Burger of the week ($15), fries with both entrees.\\n\\nThis was our first visit to Graze. We had pretty high expectations, seeing as how it is the 'sister restaurant' of L'Etoile. It certainly was the hoity-est place we've been to, and with their focus on gourmet, local ingredients, we were sure we were in for a great meal.\\n\\nFirst impressions- No reservations needed- cool! They were very busy, which for a Tuesday night was surprising, but it was election night, and there was a rally going on. The wait to get seated was about 30 minutes, not bad, but they told us 10. Noisy- very noisy. near impossible to have a conversation without shouting. The decor- seemed like they were trying for an artsy/modern look, but all I could think about was how the metal chairs were the exact same kind of metal chairs you always see in interrogation rooms on cop tv shows. Next time you are watching Law and Order, or one of the others, check out the chairs. You'll see what I mean. \\n\\nService was slow, maybe we were just impatient because we were very hungry &amp; we were in a little bit of a hurry, we wanted to check out the rally.  After what was probably 30 minutes, we were finally served our appetizers. The fried pickles were a huge disappointment. There was more breading than pickle. I honestly didn't realize you could slice a pickle that thin! Greasy, very greasy. They tasted like something you would get off a food truck at a carnival. I didn't use the sauce, the wife did and said it was good, so maybe that was the trick. In my opinion food is either good or it's not, and you shouldn't have to drench it in sauce for it to be good.  The pork buns were nothing like I was expecting, which could just be my own ignorance. I was expecting pork buns like I remembered from China One Buffet (on Broadway) back in the day. What we got looked more like a pork taco, but whatever. They tasted ok I guess, not something I would normally order, and I probably wouldn't order again.  The wife said they were 'different' which is usually code for 'not very good'.  At this point, we were feeling a little leary about our entrees.\\n\\nAfter what felt like forever (but was probably about 30 more minutes), our burgers &amp; fries came. Not sure why it took so long for two burgers and two orders of fries.  My burger was the Graze burger (fresh ground sirloin, ribeye &amp; short ribs, caramelized onions, cabernet jus, sesamse seed brioche) The burger did not come with any toppings. Just burger, bun &amp; caramelized onions. It looked a little naked, I thought. Now I didn't expect the chef to want to bury his work of beef art under a blanket of cheese (even though we are in the dairy state), but a little lettuce, tomato, pickle or even some raw onions really would have elevated this burger to something special. Without all of that it was just ok. The taste &amp; texture reminded me of a meatloaf sandwich. Which would have been fine if I'd ordered the meatloaf sandwich, but I didn't. I ordered the $19 hamburger. $19!! I guess I figured that I since ordered one of the most expensive things on the menu, that it would blow my mind, but it just didn't. My mistake. In fact, I found it a little salty, and not in a good way.\\n\\nThe wife, being more adventurous than I am, ordered the burger of the week, which we didn't hear the name of and barely heard the description of. Something about a burger with bacon, limburger cheese, and hash browns, served on a play on french toast.  She said it was 'weird, wet and kinda gross' It also was extremely messy, the 'french toast' or whatever it was pretty much disintigrated, leaving her hands a sloppy, greasy mess. \\n\\nI know right now you are probably thinking 'sheesh, don't you have anything nice to say?' Yes. I do- the french fries were very good. So there you have it. $46.42 (after tax)  for some darn good fries. \\n\\nNot what you'd call a good value. Although, after this experience, neither of us is in a hurry to try the 'sister restaurant' L'Etoile, which would have a significantly higher price tag, so in a way, dining at Graze actually saved us money in the long run. \\n\\nAn expensive lesson learned.</td>\n",
